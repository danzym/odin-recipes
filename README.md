# Odin Recipes Project

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It involves creating a simple recipe website using HTML. The website consists of three pages, each dedicated to a different recipe:

- Well-done Steak
- Classic Pierogi
- Raspberry Cheesecake

The project aims to demonstrate a clear understanding and application of basic HTML structures including headings, lists, links, and images.
