    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Start with the crust by preheating your oven to 350°F (175°C). In a bowl,
      combine 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and ½
      cup of melted unsalted butter. Press this mixture into the bottom of a
      9-inch springform pan, creating an even layer. Bake the crust for about 10
      minutes, then remove it from the oven and let it cool. Meanwhile, in a
      large mixing bowl, beat 24 ounces of softened cream cheese with 1 cup of
      sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract until smooth and creamy. Add 4
      large eggs one at a time, fully incorporating each before adding the next.
      Blend in 1 cup of sour cream. Pour this filling over your cooled crust.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the raspberry swirl, blend 12 ounces of fresh or frozen raspberries in
      a blender or food processor until smooth. Strain the mixture through a
      fine-mesh sieve to remove the seeds, discarding them. You should be left
      with a smooth raspberry sauce. Gently swirl this raspberry sauce into the
      cheesecake batter using a knife, creating a marbled effect. Bake the
      cheesecake in the preheated oven for 55-60 minutes or until the edges are
      set and the center is slightly jiggly. Turn off the oven, crack open the
      door, and let the cheesecake cool in the oven for 1 hour. After that,
      transfer it to the refrigerator to cool completely, for at least 4 hours,
      preferably overnight. Before serving, garnish your raspberry cheesecake
      with fresh raspberries and a dusting of powdered sugar. Slice, serve, and
      enjoy a rich and creamy dessert with a tangy raspberry swirl, a perfect
      blend of sweetness and tartness in every bite.
