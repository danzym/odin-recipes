    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Begin by preparing the pierogi dough. Combine 2 cups of all-purpose flour
      with a half teaspoon of salt in a large bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk
      together one large egg, a half cup of sour cream, and a quarter cup of
      butter (softened). Gradually incorporate the wet mixture into the dry
      ingredients, kneading until a smooth and elastic dough forms. Wrap the
      dough in plastic wrap and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 2
      hours to firm up and allow the gluten to relax. Meanwhile, prepare the
      filling by combining 2 cups of mashed potatoes, 1 cup of grated cheese
      (like cheddar or farmer cheese), a half finely chopped onion sautéed until
      translucent, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix it thoroughly until all the
      ingredients are well incorporated and set aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the dough has rested, roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a
      thickness of about 1/8 inch. Using a round cutter or a glass with a
      diameter of about 3 inches, cut out circles from the dough. Place a
      generous teaspoon of the filling in the center of each dough circle. Fold
      the dough over the filling to create a half-moon shape and press the edges
      firmly to seal, crimping with a fork to ensure a tight seal. Bring a large
      pot of salted water to a boil. Carefully add the pierogi, a few at a time,
      to the boiling water. Cook for 3-5 minutes or until they rise to the
      surface, indicating that they are done. Use a slotted spoon to remove the
      pierogi from the water and transfer them to a plate. Serve your homemade
      pierogi hot with a dollop of sour cream or a drizzle of melted butter. You
      can also sauté them in a pan with a bit of butter after boiling for a
      crispy exterior. Enjoy your meal accompanied by a simple salad or some
      sautéed vegetables on the side.
