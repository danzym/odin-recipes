    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Begin with a high-quality cut of steak such as ribeye, T-bone, or sirloin,
      preferably about 1 to 1.5 inches thick. Before you start cooking, let the
      steak reach room temperature to ensure even cooking; this usually takes
      about 30 to 60 minutes. Once your steak is at room temperature, season it
      generously on both sides with a blend of salt, black pepper, and a touch
      of garlic powder for added flavor. Preheat your grill or stove-top pan to
      a high heat; the pan should be smoking hot to achieve a nice sear on the
      steak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Place the steak on the grill or pan and let it cook for about 4-5 minutes
      on one side to develop a good crust. Then, flip the steak and let it cook
      on the other side for another 4-5 minutes. After this initial searing
      process, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking the steak,
      flipping it every 1-2 minutes, to prevent burning and to allow the heat to
      penetrate to the center of the steak. This flipping process should be
      carried on for about 10-12 minutes or until the internal temperature of
      the steak reaches 160째F (71째C) for a well-done level. Once it reaches the
      desired temperature, remove the steak from the heat and let it rest on a
      cutting board for about 10 minutes before slicing. This resting period
      allows the juices to redistribute throughout the steak, ensuring a moist
      and flavorful outcome. Serve your well-done steak with your favorite side
      dishes such as garlic mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. Enjoy your
      meal!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Steak cut (such as ribeye, T-bone, or sirloin) - 1 to 1.5 inches thick
      </li>
      <li>Salt - to taste</li>
      <li>Black pepper - freshly ground, to taste</li>
      <li>Garlic powder - optional, to taste</li>
      <li>Olive oil or butter - for greasing the pan, if pan-searing</li>
      <li>
        Fresh herbs (like rosemary or thyme) - optional, for additional flavor
      </li>
      <li>Butter - a small knob, to finish, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Take the Steak out of the Refrigerator: Remove your chosen cut of steak
        from the refrigerator and allow it to reach room temperature for about
        30 to 60 minutes before cooking. This promotes even cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the Steak: Once the steak is at room temperature, season it
        generously on both sides with salt, black pepper, and a hint of garlic
        powder if using.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat Your Cooking Surface: Preheat your grill or a stove-top pan over
        high heat. If using a pan, add a bit of butter or oil and allow it to
        become smoking hot to achieve a nice sear on the steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear the Steak: Place the steak on the hot grill or pan and sear it for
        about 4-5 minutes on one side to develop a good crust.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip and Sear the Other Side: Flip the steak and sear the other side for
        another 4-5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the Heat: After searing both sides, reduce the heat to
        medium-low.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue Cooking to Well-done: Continue to cook the steak, flipping it
        every 1-2 minutes, for about 10-12 minutes more or until the internal
        temperature reaches 160째F (71째C) for a well-done level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rest the Steak: Once the steak reaches the desired level of doneness,
        remove it from the heat and place it on a cutting board. Let it rest for
        about 10 minutes; this allows the juices to redistribute throughout the
        steak.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve: Slice the steak against the grain into slices, if desired, and
        serve it with your favorite side dishes. Enjoy your home-cooked,
        well-done steak!
